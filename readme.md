## Uncertainties

1. Should the maximum token supply be determined by age or a constant? Being set by the user seems like a bad idea.

2. Should there be a burn function? The pros and cons aren't super obvious vs just supporting paying with Dai

3. Would a "multi-reserve token" contract make sense? This introduces the need for price feeds which can fail over time. Already relies on Dai not failing.

4. Would it make sense to start with a multisig dao to handle lost keys?
