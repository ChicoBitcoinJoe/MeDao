    <h2>Admin Only</h2>
    <h4>set weekly hours</h4>
    <span>Can only be set once per week!</span>
    <p>Set your weekly hours to how much time you will devote to your medao each week. If you become overscheduled either set your weekly hours lower, work overtime, or both until your schedule is balanced again.</p>
    <h4>set vault address</h4>
    <span>The vault address is originally set to the Founder's address</span>
    <p>Open a panel to set a new vault address. The vault is where any ether or erc20 tokens will ultimately be transferred when sent to the MeDao. It is critical this address be a safe address that can send and receive ether and erc20 tokens. I recommend <a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys/MultiSigWallet">this</a> multisig wallet by Consensys.</p>
    <h4>set burn minimum</h4>
    <span>The burn minimum is originally set to 1 second.</span>

    <span>The owner is originally set to the Founder's address</span>
    <p>Opens a panel to set a new owner contract for your medao. It is recommended to use a multisig address (such as the one in 'set vault address'</p>
    <h4>disable/enable transfers</h4>
    <p>Toggles whether transfers are enabled or disabled. In the event of an update, clone, or hack/bug, it is smart to disabled transfers until the matter is resolves completely.</p>
    <h4>set webpage url</h4>
    <p>Opens a panel to set the webpage that details the terms of the MeDao Contract. Make sure you are very clear on your site regarding what potential shareholders are agreeing to when they invest in your time. Confusion will only hurt your reputation and self worth!</p>
