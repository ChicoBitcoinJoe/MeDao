    <h3 layout="row">What is a MeDao?</h3>
    <p>The MeDao platform enables any person to find a free market value for their own time as well as allow anyone in the world to gain exposure to the value of that person's time. This is acheived by auctioning up to 40 hours each week, 1 hour at a time, to the highest bidder. Intrinsically, 1 hours worth of tokens can be used to claim 1 hour of the Founder's time or it can be held on to if the holder believes this person's time might be more valuable in the future. A burn function is provided for people to make payments to the MeDao thus showing proof of work done by the MeDao Founder.</p>
    <p>Every MeDao comes with a <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/the-minime-token-open-sourced-by-giveth-2710c0210787">MiniMe Token</a> which keeps track of how much time is owed to each holder. A MiniMe Token is capable of being cloned at any point in the tokens history. This comes with many benefits such as simplified recovery in the event of a critical hack or bug, easy upgrading of MeDao capabilities, and it creates new ways of delivering value to shareholders.</p>
    <h4>Example Use Case</h4>
    <p>A simple use case for a MeDao clone could look as follows: A music artist creates a clone of their MeDao every time they release a song. Profit generated from selling copies of the song go directly to a contract where, at any point, a cloned token holder can burn their cloned tokens for an equal distribution of any ether held by the contract. Assuming there is demand for the artists song, the token can be traded on an exchange where the minimum value of the token is the current profits held by the burn contract and a premium equal to the potential future profits of that song. Long term holders can claim their profits at any point in the future! It is possible through "value added" that a Founder's time becomes too expensive and no one will want to claim any literal time with the Founder. This is natural and in the case of the music artist means the persons time is better spent making music instead of something like teaching music lessons. Alternatively the Founder can choose to give a discount on their literal time by accepting a fraction of a token hour in exchange for a real hour. </p>
    <h4>The Future</h4>
    <div>In the future, MeDao can evolve to use things like Bancor (liquidity as a service) and TokenCard (erc20 token debit card) to create a personal credit card. Shareholders would set a card max and minimum payment. If the MeDao owner misses a few payments the max would decrease until they are caught up. If their 'credit score' get's too low their exchange/auction rate would suffer and thus their hourly wage as well.</div>
